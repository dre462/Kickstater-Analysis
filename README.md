# An analysis of Kickstater campaigns Outcomes based on thier Launch Dates and Funding Goals
The purpose of this data analysis of campaigns outcomes is to help determine how and if the 'the date in which the campaign was launched' and 'the funding goals of the campaign' has contributed to the apparent outcomes of the campagns. This analysis was done by first using a pivot table and a pivot chart to depict the relationship between theatre campaign outcomes and their launch months. Then with the use of charts, codes and functions to depict the percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on their funding goal amounts.

For the theatre Outcome based on Launch Date: 
I first created a pivot table then filtering based on the year and Parent Category, then I put the outcomes as columns and the months created as rows and then creating a line chart to depict the number of failed, sucessful and canceled project based on their creation month.

For the Outcome Based on Goals: 
After naming the appropriate columns in the worksheet I then used the CountIF function to populate each columns by filtering on the Kickstater Outcomes column, Goal amount column and Subcategory column using "theatre' as my filter. A challenge that I encountered in this deliverable was accurately applying the countIF function, I initially ommited the theatre subcategory when applying the function. 


2 conclusions I draw about the theatre launch date include:
* May has the highest number of plays with it also having the highest number of successful outcomes. 
* October has the lowest number of cancellation with zero cancellations. 

Conclusion on Outcome Based on Goals:
* The lower the goal amount the higher the percenatge of success.

Limitations:
* A limitation about this dataset is the presence of outliers.

Additional charts that could be created include Bar Charts, Histogram and Box/Whisker chart to check for outliers.
