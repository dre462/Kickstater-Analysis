# An analysis of Kickstater campaigns Outcomes based on thier Launch Dates and Funding Goals
This analysis was done by first using a pivot table and a pivot chart to depict the relationship between theatre campaign outcomes and thier launch month. Then I used certain excel codes and functions to depict the percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on their funding goal amounts.
* 2 conclusions I draw about the theatre launch date include: -May has the highest number of plays with it also having the highest number of successful outcomes.                                                                 -October has the lowest number of cancellation with zero cancellations.                               * The lower the goal amount the higher the percenatge of success.                                                                                                   * A limitation about this dataset is the presence of outliers.
